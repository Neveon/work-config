gx -> opens url link (that is highlighted?).

In visual mode (capital V for whole lines):
  - we can tab over multiple lines with > or <
  - move highlighted text up/down with ALT-j and ALT-k

  
-----Neovim Completion-----

As you write there will be autocomplete miniwindow under your text.
This is the following commands you can take.

When a ghost text comes up, <CR> will autocomplete it.

Ctrl-b => Scroll down the documentation
Ctrl-f => Scroll up the documentation
Ctrl-e => remove suggested popup completions
Tab => scroll down through completions
shift-Tab => scroll up through completions
  
gl -> Get detail of problems/errors or info (LspInfo).
  
Naviagte buffers with Shift-l or Shift-r
*Buffers are created from editing other files using such actions as below*

<leader>e -> File explorer
  % -> Create a new file in the directory.



-----Telescope----- 
  - Good for finding what you already know the name of

<leader>f -> Telescope find files related to what you type.
gd -> (Telescope) Go to the definition of the variable under the cursor.
gr -> (Telescope) Go to the references of the variable under the cursor.


-----Gitsigns-----

:Gitsigns next_hunk => This command moves to the next hunk of changes in the file and also gives you the number of changes present.
:Gitsigns preview_hunk => Popup shows you the changes made in the hunk the cursor is currently at.
:Gitsigns blame_line => Popup shows short commit hash, user who made and time of change and commit comments where the cursor is at.
(All other commands can be found in :Gitsigns)


-----Github Copilot-----

:Copilot status => lets us know any issues with Copilot

Writing descriptions in comments will outline what copilot will write.
After the comment, code up what you think the solution will be, remove neovim autocomplete with crl-e
and ghost text will autocomplete the solution.
Ctrl-a will autocomplete using the ghost text.
